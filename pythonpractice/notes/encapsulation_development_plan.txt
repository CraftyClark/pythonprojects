A development plan is a process of writing programs.
The process we used while creating polygon.py is called "encapsulation and generalization". 
The steps of this process are:
	1. Start by writing a small program w/ no function definitions.
	2. Once you get program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name. 
	3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters. 
	4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging)
	5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example if you have similiar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.
